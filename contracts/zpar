# Run z3 and paradox in parallel on argument file
# and when either terminates, kill the other
#
# Usage:
#
#    ./zpar FILE
#
# where FILE is a tptp file you want to use. A good idea can
# be to use either of these greps:
#
#    ./zpar FILE | grep -i sat
#    ./zpar FILE | grep -e (RESULT|status)
#
#!/bin/bash

# Allow registering signals

set -bm

# Launch the theorem provers and store their pids.

# Unfortunately you cannot pipe to grep here, because then the pid
# stored in $! will refer to the program to the right of the pipe.

paradox $1 &
PARADOX_PID=$!

z3 -tptp -nw $1 &
Z3_PID=$!

# Trap the signal that a child has terminated, and when this happens
# kill both theorem provers, ignoring warnings.

trap '(kill $PARADOX_PID 2> /dev/null); (kill $Z3_PID 2> /dev/null)' CHLD

# Wait until all processes has been killed, ignoring warnings about
# killed children

wait 2> /dev/null
